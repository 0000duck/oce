+Version 0.8.0 - December 2011
+
+* Added more unit tests 
+
+* Help building on systems without cmake, in particular with WOK
+
+* Removed deprecated bcc32 project files
+
+* bcc32 and bcc xe edition support
+
+* Fixes to allow building with cmake 2.6 - cmake 2.8 is stricly required only
+  when running unit tests
+
+* Added Standard_StdAllocator class + UnitTest
+
+* Added an option to disable the bspline mesher, and reverts to OFF 
+  (not disabled) the default behavoir
+
+* Correctly set DEB,_DEBUG and NDEBUG defines. Enabling DEB (additional 
+  debug code) is now an option
+
+* Macro fixes in Draw package
+
+* Solves a copy-paste bug in TDataXtd_PatternStd (bug #195)
+
+* Add support installing libraries into lib64
+
+* Ensure that GLU is found when checking for OpenGL
+
+* Fixed opengl (ftgl) font issue
+

+
+Version 0.7.0 - October 2011
+
+* Updated build and install instructions
+
+* Allow changing default values of MMGT_* variables  
+  The following macros can be set when compiling to override
+  default settings:
+    MMGT_OPT_DEFAULT  
+    MMGT_CLEAR_DEFAULT  
+    MMGT_MMAP_DEFAULT  
+    MMGT_CELLSIZE_DEFAULT  
+    MMGT_NBPAGES_DEFAULT  
+    MMGT_THRESHOLD_DEFAULT  
+    MMGT_REENTRANT_DEFAULT  
+
+* Allow building unversioned libraries : 
+  Third-party applications which embed OCE may find convenient
+  to drop version numbers from libraries.  
+  With this commit, one can call cmake -DOCE_NO_LIBRARY_VERSION=ON.  
+  This is based on a similar feature found in VTK.
+
+* Disabled the BSpline mesher, since it generates over-refined meshes. 
+  The generic one will be used instead.
+
+* Removed src/FontMFT/*.mft files
+
+* More tests added : Step import and mesher
+
+* Win32 specific changes :
+  - Install Debug and Release libraries into the same directory
+  - Automatically define WNT depending on compiler predefined macros
+  - Auto-install TBB dlls
+  - Export the target informations in Win32. This allows to find OCE from 
+    cmake projects even win 32.
+  - Fixed mingw64 compilation
+
+* Some additional GCC warning removals
+
+* Other minor fixes

+
+Version 0.6.0 - September 2011
+
+ *   Cmake 2.8 is explicitly required to build OCE.
+
+ *   Removed many X11 dependencies. Now it is possible to build a large part of
+     OCE (with the exception of visualisation) without depending on X11 (using
+     OCE_DISABLE_X11 option).
+
+ *   Cmake support : Cmake users will be able to correctly find OCE using
+     FIND_PACKAGE(OCE). Several examples are added to show how to use it in
+     end-user programs. It is now possible to detect/request single toolkits.
+
+ *   Packaging : change installation paths; we do no more install files at the
+     same location as OpenCascade, but adopted more standard paths.
+
+ *   Tests : integrated gtest 1.6.0 and added other unit tests, which helped in
+     fixing some bugs. Added MSVC support to the testsuite.
+
+ *   Win32/MSVC improvements:
+     + Enabled configuration files in Win32 platforms
+     + Plugins and TKOpenGL are correctly found in debug builds
+     + TKOpenGL works when building static libraries
+
+ *   Modify tcl scripts to not require $env(CASROOT).
+
+ *   Many small changes, bug fixes and warning removals.
+     + Improvements to OSD_Process::SystemDate()
+     + TKernel : add dependency against -ldl.
+     + Bugfix : Work around a cmake bug that prevented building Win64+MSVC+static libs
+     + Bugfix : add missing include in BRepBlend_BlendTool.lxx.
+     + Bugfix : fix mismatch new/delete in Standard_Failure.cxx
+     + Fixed compiler warnings in OpenGl_TextureBox.cxx
+     + Whitespace cleanup
+     + In module TKOpenGL, fixed the two remaining GCC warnings of the form :
+       "comparison between ‘enum texStatus’ and ‘enum texDataStatus’"
+     + Added missing include in BRepBlend_BlendTool.lxx
+     + Fix capitalization of include file
+     + pass NULL for timezone pointer to gettimeofday()
+     + eliminate bad cast by copying to local variable
+     + use localtime_r if available
+     + Do not redefine memmove as an alias for memcpy
+     + Workaround GCC (< 4.3) bugs in gp_Mat, gp_XYZ, gp_Mat2d and gp_XY.
+     + Fix HashCode, it could segault when MMGT_OPT is not set to 1.

+Version 0.5.0 - August 2011
+
+This released integrated OCCT 6.5.1, continued on the warning cleanup, and
+fixed some bugs. This a ABI breaking release, due to the warning fixes
+and the new OCCT version.
+Programs compiled with OCCT 6.5.1 will compile untouched with OCE 0.5.0
+
+ *   OCCT 6.5.1 : aligned to the lasted OpenCascade Tecnology release,
+     while mantaining all the patches previously applyed.
+
+ *   Breaking changes : to allow the removal of many compiler warnings, we
+     did some breaking changes in some of the headers, mainly related to the
+     type of private class fields. Existing code will still compile untouched.
+
+ *   Warning removal and code cleanup : we removed many other warnings and
+     cleaned up some functions. Some cppcheck warnings were also fixed.
+
+ *   Added TBB support in memory allocation : OCE builds compiled with the
+     TBB option on will benefit from it's multithreaded memory allocator.
+
+ *   Bug fixes : some bugs were spotted during the cleanup process, and
+     were fixed and reported. Other bugs were noticed from the forum and
+     fixed.
+
+ *   Installing version information : Programs using CMake will allow to find
+     OCE with a specific version string.
+
+ *   Program using OCE won't require to compile with -DHAVE_OCE_CONFIG anymore.

+
+Version 0.4.0 - July 2011
+
+This release focused on improving code quality and the cmake build system.
+
+ *   CPack support : including DEB,RPM and MacOsX package generation
+
+ *   CTest support : initial infrastructure to develop unit tests using
+     googletest and CTest. Actually working in Linux and MacOsX.
+
+ *   CDash support : http://my.cdash.org/index.php?project=OCE to see the
+     status of the tests on various platforms
+
+ *   Fixed many compiler warnings: this allows to have a cleaner compilation
+     and helped in finding some bugs. Probably many of the annoying MSVC CRT
+     debug error windows are also gone.
+     Some warnings may still be present, and will be fixed in successive versions.
+
+ *   Added NMake support
+ *   Drastically reduced MSVC compilation time, using precompiled headers
+
+ *   Added version information in Win32 DLLs: this information will be useful
+     for installers and packaging systems.
+
+ *   Let OCEConfig.cmake use relative paths in order to allow moving
+     install tree (related to Linux and MacOsX)
